# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 

Pewlett-Hackard has requested an employee analysis related to firm-wide succession planning. The firm is anticipating a rapid rate of retirement in the near term that will potentially result in thousands of job openings. They are prepared to offer a retirement package to those who meet specific eligibility requirements. The analysis will include which employees are eligible for retirement and how many positions will become available.  

Data will be sourced from six csv files that will be loaded into sql as tables and used for further analysis.

## Summary

* The current analysis shows approximately 90,000 employees will qualify for the proposed retirement package. The actual timing will be dependent on acceptance of said retirement packages and the ability to fill open positions while minimizing impact to the broader organization and business units.
    
* At this time there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation at Pewlett-Hackard. With the pool of potential retirees accounting for almost 30% of the firm's workforce, it will be important to focus on which departments would benefit from a formal mentor program. This will allow for the organic growth of current employees into more senior and management roles. A formal mentor/mentee program will assist in the transition of institutional knowledge to the next generation.
